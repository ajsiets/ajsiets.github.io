                As you leave the mega city of larger social media and big hosting sites, you traverse the fields
                of the wild web, and happen across a small shack. The shack is empty, but you find stairs that lead
                down into a basement. The basement is also empty, except for a large hole in the center of the floor.
                As you approach the hole, you feel drawn to peer into its depths, a faint blue glow lighting your
                face. You feel compelled to peer deeper, but you lose your footing and fall in. Welcome, to...

                This site is a repository for the goings on within my head. 
                These thoughts tend to be rather rambly, so I have always shied
                away from social media, due to its reliance on short-form and
                concise thoughts. This will be part blog, part playground as 
                I learn how to code HTML and CSS, and part dumping ground to
                share story ideas and art and whatever else I create. I'll
                list the most recent blog posts just below here, and have
                relevent links off to the side.

                <h2>Story Post - 8/10/2024</h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first story post, so I'll give a quick explanation for the structure I'll 
                    be using for these. My plan is to title them as Story Posts instead of Blog Posts, 
                    but I'll otherwise format and treat them the same, and archive them in the same place 
                    (for now, that is). I also might put a little blurb at the start saying what story idea 
                    it is on the first post of a story, and I'll have the title plus whatever number post/
                    chapter it is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This story idea I'm goin to call The Wasting. I might stick with that as the final 
                    title, or change it later if I come up with something better.

                    <p>
                        Oh how the world had fallen. Caleb splashed through the muck, barren and gnarled 
                        branches whipped and snagged at his skin, leaving razor-thin cuts along his 
                        exposed flesh. A bulbous and misshapen beast snarled after him, clambering 
                        ceaselessly through the brush. Its thick rubbery skin slapped as it hit the mud, 
                        hands grasping at clumps of watery earth, the mouth in its eyeless face agape, 
                        its terrifyingly human teeth gnashing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Caleb could feel his legs burning as he fought against the suction of the mud he 
                        crashed through, but he dared not stop with that 
                        thing only a few paces behind. He needed to get out of this horrid, grey 
                        swampland, and back into the horrid, grey forests beyond. Much of the world was 
                        blighted by the Wasting, a devastating plague that ate everything in its path, 
                        man, beast, and plant. Along with the Wasting came foul creatures, twisted and 
                        hungry, bent on tearing apart anything the Wasting missed in its path of 
                        destruction. Caleb remembered the world before, lush and beautiful, the farm he 
                        had grown up on with his family. He remembered when the fall happened. It 
                        started with the plants. The crops began to whither and die, turning a sickly 
                        grey as they wilted and turned to dust where they grew. Next came the animals. 
                        It started with the smaller livestock, the fowl, then worked its way up to the pigs 
                        and the cows. They became lethargic, ambling around the pasture as if in a daze, 
                        and after only a few days, they looked as if they hadn’t eaten in months. 
                        Nothing Caleb or his family did seemed to cure the animals of their ailments. 
                        Then they started to decay where they stood, turning into walking husks that 
                        collapsed and once again turned to dust. Not even the bones remained. After the 
                        animals, it was the people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Caleb shook the memories from his mind. They would not serve him in this moment, 
                        he needed to stay focused. He nearly tripped over an exposed tree root from the 
                        leafless husk of a tree that speared out of the sludge. He gripped onto the trunk 
                        to prevent himself from falling in, but the creature used the momentary hesitation 
                        to lunge. Caleb used his momentum to swing around the tree, flinging himself past 
                        it but fully loosing his footing in the process. The creature’s lunge sent it 
                        into the tree where Caleb had stood mere seconds before, its teeth clamped around 
                        the trunk. Caleb staggered and fell backwards into the mud, squelching and 
                        beginning to sink. He flailed his arms back, attempting to boost himself back up, 
                        but couldn’t get hold of anything. The creature quickly reared back and bellowed 
                        a low, wet, guttural noise at him. It splashed back down into the murky swamp 
                        water and continued its mad dash for its prey. Caleb panicked and tried to reach 
                        for anything to pull himself free.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just as the creature was about to fall upon him, Caleb felt a firm grasp on his 
                        outstretched hand, and was yanked aside. The creature cried out in frustration as 
                        it crashed into the muck where Caleb had been, and whirled around to see what 
                        dared take away its prey. Caleb looked up from where he had been dragged and saw 
                        fierce eyes staring down the abomination that stood before them. It was another 
                        human, clad in light battle gear, a sword in one hand, and Caleb’s still in the 
                        other. They wore a pendent around their neck on a golden chain, a symbol from the 
                        Holy Church of Caladia. The stranger dropped Caleb’s hand, then set themselves 
                        into a low battle stance. The creature charged the two, and Caleb watched as the 
                        stranger deftly tipped their sword, driving it deep just below the creatures left 
                        shoulder, and sliding to the side, as if the mud were no hindrance at all. Their 
                        blade sliced with the motion, leveraging it up and over the shoulder, nearly 
                        taking the arm off. The horrible beast staggered, unable to place weight onto its 
                        left arm, and slamming into the sludge. It tried to pull itself back up, but 
                        black bubbling blood began to pour from its mouth, and it collapsed, gurgling 
                        through haggard breaths.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The stranger stood still for a moment, watching the foul thing, then they wiped 
                        off their blade and sheathed it at their side. They turned to Caleb, and spoke.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Those things are just bags of meat, really. Pretty easy to slice through if 
                        you know what you’re doing.” They offered their hand to Caleb, who gratefully 
                        took it. “You look like you could use a change of clothes, and a bath,” the 
                        stranger said, looking Caleb up and down.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Caleb looked at himself. After rolling around to get away from the creature, 
                        he was caked from head to toe in the foul smelling muck. “You’ve already saved 
                        my life, I can’t ask for more than that. I wish I had something to give you as 
                        thanks.” It was true, Caleb had nothing to his name, beyond the clothes he wore, 
                        and that were now ruined, and a moldy hunk of bread he had been lucky enough to 
                        scrounge up while looking through an abandoned farmstead he had passed through 
                        a day prior. Now that he thought about it, the bread was probably ruined too, 
                        after all that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I heard tell of a sanctuary west from here, ” Caleb said, “I was hoping I 
                        would happen upon it before the day's end, if it weren’t for that blasted 
                        abomination finding me here in the swamp.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The stranger smiled, “Well, it seems you’re in luck, friend, as I happen to 
                        come from there.” They clapped Caleb on the back, and offered their hand, 
                        “The name’s Casey.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Caleb,” he sighed, as relief washed over him. He took Casey's hand, “Nice to meet’ya.”

                <h2>Blog Post - 8/10/2024</h2>
                <p>
                    Ok, so, it's been a week since my last update and I haven't done very many changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Woopsie! <=)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I kinda got into another Minecraft hyperfixation, so I've been doing that during all 
                    of my free time instead of working on the website!! I have dabbled a little bit, if 
                    you can see the attempt at a swatch clock at the top of the page, which I can't seem 
                    to get working, but I'll keep at it! I've also put my name and pronouns in the "About 
                    Me" tab, so that's a start! I'll post some pics here of the Minecraft world I've been 
                    playing in to make up for a lack of other content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's a Skyblock map using a datapack called 'Skyblock Infinite' which I'll put a link 
                    to <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/skyblock-infinite-5989188/">here</a> 
                    in case anyone's interested in checking it out! What's special about Skyblock Infinite 
                    is that you can spwan on a variety of different islands themed after different biomes, 
                    because the datapack takes your seed into account! It also spawns a few extra islands 
                    around you based on other biomes that would naturally be there based on the seed. The 
                    final part that makes it 'infinite' is that it also spawn structures! You can travel 
                    outward like you normally would and find all sorts of structures that would naturally 
                    spwan there. I got lucky and the seed I'm using spawned an entire Ancient City right 
                    under my island!! I got the idea to try it from a recent video by 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Legundo">Legundo</a> on YouTube, who posts a lot of 
                    Harcore 100 Days videos. Inspired by that I've also been playing on Hardcore, and have 
                    already died once =(. I'ts been fun though, however, I continue to be reminded that 
                    phantoms are the WORST!!!!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides all that, not much else has been going on. It's been a little colder (down to 
                    around 60 degrees F at night! (or 15C)) around where I live, which is great because I 
                    overheat easily, and I work outside! Having the window open at night is always very nice 
                    too. Speaking of my work, I might make blog posts called something like "Tales from the 
                    Mail Truck" if anything interesting happens out on my delivery routes (I work for a large 
                    package delivery service. One might even call it THE large package delivery service, not 
                    to invoke its name aloud). I think that could be fun. Anyway, enough rambling, I hope you 
                    all have a wonderful day/night!

                <h2>Blog Post - 8/3/2024</h2>
                <p>
                    My first blog post! I'll use this one to go over my plans for the site and what 
                    I'm currently working on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On this main page here I'll put the most important elements, links to other places 
                    on the site, some of the most recent posts, random fun decorations, and other 
                    things I'll eventually think of. I'm hosting this site on GitHub, which I have been 
                    told only hosts static sites, so I can't use JavaScript, but if that ever becomes
                    an issue I can just migrate to a host that allows it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I am working on my "About Me" page, so you all can get an idea of who 
                    I am and what I'm into. After that I would like to get a Gallery up and running 
                    where I can store my art. I don't get around to making stuff very often, but it's 
                    something I would like to try and do more. The Blog Archive will fill up with all 
                    past posts, as I don't want to fill up my main page with more than around 5 at a 
                    time. I'm thinking I'll organize them by sets of time as well, probably years, and 
                    I'll put a link at the top to jump to the years as time goes on. Hopefully I'll
                    keep up with it all, I have a bad habit of starting a project and dropping it 
                    after a week or two to start another equally ambitious project (ADHD is very fun).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'll also put my email up so you can contact me about stuff, and I can link to 
                    other sites I'm active on. At the moment that's really only BlueSky, but I also 
                    made an account on the Melonland Forum today as a way to meet and keep in touch 
                    with other people who are making sites like these! I also just saw a site earlier
                    that had a live chat on the sidebar, which looked really cool. Or I could try 
                    adding a way to leave comments, like a GuestBook or something. Not sure if either 
                    is possible without JavaScript though, but I'll look into it!
                </p>

                    Alright, I think that about wraps it up! I hope you all have a lovely day, or night
                    depending on where and when you are reading this! Kisses to all, and farewell.
